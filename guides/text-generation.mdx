The text generation models provided have been trained to understand natural language, code, and images. The models provide text outputs in response to their inputs. The inputs to these models are also referred to as "prompts". Designing a prompt is essentially how you “program” a large language model model, usually by providing instructions or some examples of how to successfully complete a task.

With text generation models, you can build applications to:

- Draft documents
- Write computer code
- Answer questions about a knowledge base
- Analyze texts
- Give software a natural language interface
- Tutor in a range of subjects
- Translate languages
- Simulate characters for games
