Learn how to use vision capabilities to understand images.

## Introduction

Both GPT-4o and GPT-4 Turbo have vision capabilities, meaning the models can take in images and answer questions about them. Historically, language model systems have been limited by taking in a single input modality, text.

## Quick start

Images are made available to the model in two main ways: by passing a link to the image or by passing the base64 encoded image directly in the request. Images can be passed in the user, system and assistant messages. Currently we don't support images in the first system message but this may change in the future.

It is important to keep in mind the limitations of the model as you explore what use-cases visual understanding can be applied to.
